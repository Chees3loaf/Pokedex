Ingredients
3-4 pound boneless pork shoulder (Boston butt)
1/2 cup low-sodium chicken broth
1/3 cup apple cider vinegar
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
3 teaspoons kosher salt
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 teaspoons onion powder
2 teaspoons smoked paprika
2 teaspoons dry ground mustard
1 teaspoon cumin
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper , or to taste
8 soft sandwich rolls , for serving

1) Trim any excess fat (but not all) from the pork shoulder, then cut into 4 equal pieces.
 
2) In a small bowl whisk together the brown sugar and all the seasonings; rub the spice mixture all over the pork pieces thoroughly

3) Pour the chicken broth and vinegar into the base of your slow cooker. Add in the seasoned pork pieces. Cover with lid. Cook on LOW for 8-10 hours or until pork is very tender and easily separates when pulled with a fork. 

4) Remove from slow cooker, transfer pork to a clean work surface and shred with two forks. Drizzle a little of the slow cooker juices over the meat to moisten, if necessary. Serve as desired.

5) Pile pork on rolls, and top with barbecue sauce

6) Enjoy!
